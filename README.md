# EXTRSTHIC
Basically im trying to make an interactive fiction game and currently it works for the most part the only problem i seem to 
run into is that when moving the user can only move in one direction and cant move back to the orginal location for instance
if you start 4|5|6 at 5 and move to 4 you can move back to 5 youre stuck at 4
